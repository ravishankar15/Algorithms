Background:
  - Aims to "Separate the construction of a complex object from its reperesentation so that the same construction process can create diffrent representations"
  - It is used to construct the object step by step and the final step would return the object

Participents.,
  - Product - defines the type of the complex object that is to be generated by the builder pattern.
  - Builder - abstract base class that defines all of the steps that must be taken in order to correctly create a product. Each step is abstract and the actual implementation is done in the concrete subclasses.
  - Concrete Builder -  These classes contains the functionality to create a particular complex product.
  - Director  - The director class controls the algorithm that generates the final product object.

Example.,
  - Consider home construction where it involves many steps basement construction, roof construction but the same can be used to built diffrent type of buildings.

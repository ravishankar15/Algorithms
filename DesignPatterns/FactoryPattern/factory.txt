Factory Pattern
	- Factory method is a creational design pattern, related to object creation
	- In factory pattern, we create object without exposing the creation logic to client and the client uses the same common interface
    	to create new type of object

Implementation of Factory design pattern,
	- The creator class can be an abstract class
	- The creator class can be a concrete class with the factory method as a virtual function
	- The factory method may be parameterized to allow creation of diffrent types of objects.
	- The factory method can be a static method
	- The factory method can be an instance method

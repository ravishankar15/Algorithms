Background:
  - Template method design pattern is to define an algorithm as skeleton of operations and leave the details to be implemented by the child classes. 
  - The overall structure and sequence of all algorithm is preserved by the parent class.
  - In template method pattern we have preset structure method called template method which consistes of steps.
  - This is behavioral pattern easiest to understand and implement.

Participents.,
  - Abstract class - contains the template method which should be made final so that it cannot be overridden. All operations used by the template method are made abstract, so their implementation is deferred to subclasses.
  - Concrete classes - implements all the operations required by the templateMethod that were defined as abstract in the parent class.

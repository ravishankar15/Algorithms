Background:
  - Prototype allows us to hide the complexity of making new instances from the client.
  - The concept is to copy an existing object rather than creating a new instance from the scratch, something that may include costly operation.
  - The existing object acts as a prototype and the newly copied object may change same properties only if required.
  - The approach saves costly resources and time especially when the object creating is a heavy process.
  - The protorype design pattern is a creational pattern.

Participents:
  - Prototype - This is the prototype of actual object.
  - Prototype Register - This is used as a registry service to have all prototypes accessible using simple string parameters.
  - Client - will be responsible for using registry service to access prototype instances.

When to use,
  - When a system should be independent of how its products are created, composed and represented.
  - When classes to instantiate are specified at run-time.

Introduction:
  - Singleton is a gang of "four design pattern" and it is categorized under creational design pattern
  - Sometimes we need to have only one instance of our class for example a single DB connection shared by multiple objects as creating a separate DB connection for every object may be costly.
  - Similarly there can be a single configuration manager or error manager in an application

Definition:
  - The singleton pattern is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object

Points to be noted,
  - Singleton classes can have only one instance and that instance should be globally accessible.
  - Singleton Design Pattern is a type of creational design pattern
  - Outer class should be prevented to create instance of singleton classes.

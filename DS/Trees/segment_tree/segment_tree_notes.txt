Segment Tree,
- A very flexible data structure used to solve numerous range query problems like,
    finding minimum, maximum sum/greatest common divisor/least common denominator in O(logn) TC

what is segment tree?
- A segment tree is a binary tree where each node represents an interval. Generally a node would store 
one or more properties of the interval which can be queried later.

why do we need this?
- Many problems require that we give results based on query over a range or segment of available data. 
The segment tree lets us process this type of queries in lograthemic order of time.
Eg., We may have large number of points in space at certain distances from a central point/origin. Suppose
we have to lookup the points which are in a certain range of distances from our origin. An ordinary lookup
table would require a linear scan over all the possible points or all possible distances

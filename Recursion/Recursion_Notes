=> Recursion
	-> The process in which the function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called a recursive function
	-> Every recursive solution should have a base case. The first step of framing a recursive solution is to identify the base case.

=>Tailed Recursion
	-> A recursive function is tail recursive when recursive call is the last thing excecuted by the function.
		E.g., public void print(int n){

			//Base Condition
			if(n<0)
				return;
				
			System.out.println(n+" ");

			//The last executed statement is recursive call
			print(n-1);
		}
